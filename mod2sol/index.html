		It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
		The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, 
		who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; 
		who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of 
		high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, 
		so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

	I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of 
	the lives of non-combatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, 
	been deemed innocent and legitimate. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be...It is a distressing and 
	oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial 
	and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, 
	civilization itself seeming to be in the balance.	</p>

	This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. This war is not over as a result of the Battle of France. This war is a world war. 
	All the mistakes, all the delays, all the suffering, do not alter the fact that there are, in the world, all the means necessary to crush our enemies 
	one day. Vanquished today by mechanical force, in the future we will be able to overcome by a superior mechanical force. The fate of the world depends 
	on it. 	I, General de Gaulle, currently in London, invite the officers and the French soldiers who are located in British territory or who might end up 
	here, with their weapons or without their weapons, I invite the engineers and the specialised workers of the armament industries who are located in 
	British territory or who might end up here, to put themselves in contact with me. "Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be 
	extinguished and will not be extinguished.	</p>
